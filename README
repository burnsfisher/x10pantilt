This driver supports the X10 CM19A USB RF Transceiver.
To install, simply follow these steps:

1. Uninstall any version of pyusb that may already be installed on your computer.  Currently, Linux distributions often include a version of pyusb that is too old, and it conflicts with the new one.
2. Install pyusb 1.0 as described on http://pyusb.sf.net.
3. Plugin the X10 CM19A transceiver
4. Grant access to the appropriate USB device to your preferred user account
5. As that user, run python pycm19a.py

(click the "X10..." link in the sidebar at http://m.lemays.org for a more detailed tutorial)

To control your transceiver, format your commands as
described by these regular expressions:

[-+][a-p][01][1-9]

For example:
 - to turn on device c16: +c16
 - to turn off device d8: -d8
 - etc.

[udlr][a-p]

Ninja Pan'n'Tilt commands:
 u = up
 d = down
 l = left
 r = right

[bs][a-p][01][0-9]
Lamp module commands:
 b = brighten
 s = soften

Special thanks to Neil Cherry of the Linux-HA project for giving
me some code to jump off of while developing the Linux Kernel driver
that preceded this driver.
Here's his page: http://home.comcast.net/~ncherry/common/cm19a/cm19a.html

Thanks also to the others that have given me bug reports and feedback
on this driver and its ancestors!
